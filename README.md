# GIS5777_week1
Test datasets for week 1

I have added a sample dataset for you to play with on the server. The 2000 Census tracts for the state of Minnesota.
To load the dataset in your own database to the following steps.

1. Connect to your database
2. Run the mn_2000_census_tracts_table.sql in the pgAdmin
This contains the create table statement.
3. Load the table using the psql console, see the mn_census_tract_loader.txt file for options
